For commit messages, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This means that commit messages should be structured in a specific way to convey the type of change being made.

# Commit Messages

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

# Pull Requests

Pull requests should follow the same format as a commit message and only be one line summarizing the key change. The body of the pull request should contain a more detailed description of the change, including any relevant information such as the motivation for the change, how it was implemented, and any potential impact on existing code.
