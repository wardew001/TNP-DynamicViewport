To build a plugin that dynamically links model space objects to paper space viewports inside AutoCAD.
When a user moves a "model space view frame" object, the corresponding paper space viewport should automatically update to center itself based on the new position.

This is part of a larger project focused on automating sheet production workflows for civil engineering projects.


Detailed Requirements:
1. Model Space View Frame Object
Create a simple rectangular polyline or block in model space.
This object will represent the target area shown in the paper space viewport.
Attach a custom identifier or metadata to link it to a paper space viewport.

2. Paper Space Viewport
Create a corresponding viewport object in a specified layout (paper space).
Link the viewport to the model space object.

3. Event-Driven Synchronization
Attach an ObjectARX Reactor to the model space object.
When the model space object is moved, resized, or modified, automatically update the linked viewport:
Center the viewport on the new model space object center.
Optionally adjust viewport width/height if the size of the model space object changes.
If the user pans inside the unlocked viewport, do not overwrite user panning unless configured.

4. Object Linking
Implement a reliable link between the model space object and the viewport using:
Ensure links survive DWG saves and reopen.

5. Cleanup
Manage reactor lifetimes properly.
Avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers when objects are erased or drawings are closed.


Technical Expectations:
Development using AutoCAD ObjectARX SDK (latest 2025 SDK preferred)
C++ expertise
Familiarity with AutoCAD database management (open, close, upgradeOpen, downgradeOpen)
Proper use of transactions
Exception-safe coding

Plugin should be delivered as a .arx file, along with full source code
